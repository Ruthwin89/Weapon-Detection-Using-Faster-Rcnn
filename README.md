# Weapon-Detection-Using-Faster-Rcnn
This project implements a Deep Learning-based Weapon Detection System using Faster R-CNN for real-time object detection. The system automatically identifies weapons such as guns and knives from both images and video streams, making it suitable for intelligent surveillance in sensitive areas like airports, schools, and public spaces.
